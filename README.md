# Echo-protocol-in-TCP
The Echo Protocol in TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a simple network protocol used for testing and diagnostic purposes. It works by sending data from a client to a server, and the server echoes (sends back) exactly the same data to the client. This allows the client to verify that the data was received and transmitted correctly.
